Helium IoT Working Group Grants Program
Welcome to the Helium IoT Working Group Grants Program! This GitHub repository serves as the open-access platform for submitting, reviewing, and tracking grant applications focused on advancing IoT development within the Helium ecosystem. Our goal is to make the grant process transparent, collaborative, and efficient.

Repository Overview
This repository is structured to host all aspects of the grants program:

Grant Applications: Submitted and managed through pull requests (PRs).
Templates: Standardized templates for applications, milestone updates, and final reports.
Project Board: A centralized board tracking each application’s status and progress.
Decisions: Documentation of the grant approval or denial process with rationale.
How the Process Works
Submit an Application: Applicants fork this repository, create a new application in the /applications folder, and open a PR for submission.
Review: The application is reviewed by the IoT Working Group, with feedback provided directly in the PR.
Approval: Approved applications are documented in /decisions and moved to the “Approved” column on the Project board.
Funding and Updates: Approved applicants receive funding and provide milestone updates in this repository as they progress.
Final Report: Upon project completion, grantees submit a final report.
Repository Structure
/applications: Each application will be stored here in a subfolder, created by the applicant as part of their PR submission.
/templates: This folder contains templates for the grant application, milestone updates, and final report.
/decisions: Final decisions (approved or denied) are documented here, along with reasoning for the decision.
Project Board: The project board provides a visual tracker for all applications, with columns representing each stage in the application lifecycle.
How to Apply
