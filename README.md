# **Helium IoT Grants Program**

Welcome to the Helium IoT Grants Program! This GitHub repository serves as the open-access platform for submitting, reviewing, and tracking grant applications focused on advancing IoT development within the Helium ecosystem. Our goal is to make the grant process transparent, collaborative, and efficient.

## **Repository Overview**

This repository is structured to host all aspects of the grants program:
- **Grant Applications**: Submitted and managed through pull requests (PRs).
- **Templates**: Standardized templates for applications, milestone updates, and final reports.
- **Project Board**: A centralized board tracking each application’s status and progress.
- **Decisions**: Documentation of the grant approval or denial process with rationale.

## **How the Process Works**

1. **Submit an Application**: Applicants fork this repository, create a new application in the `/applications` folder, and open a PR for submission.
2. **Review**: The application is reviewed by the IoT Working Group, with feedback provided directly in the PR.
3. **Approval**: Approved applications are documented in `/decisions` and moved to the “Approved” column on the Project board.
4. **Funding and Updates**: Approved applicants receive funding and provide milestone updates in this repository as they progress.
5. **Final Report**: Upon project completion, grantees submit a final report.

## **Repository Structure**

- **`/applications`**: Each application will be stored here in a subfolder, created by the applicant as part of their PR submission.
- **`/templates`**: This folder contains templates for the grant application, milestone updates, and final report.
- **`/decisions`**: Final decisions (approved or denied) are documented here, along with reasoning for the decision.
- **Project Board**: The project board provides a visual tracker for all applications, with columns representing each stage in the application lifecycle.

## **How to Apply**

1. **Fork This Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Application Folder**: In your fork, create a new folder under `/applications` with your project name (e.g., `/applications/your_project_name`).
3. **Use the Application Template**: Inside your new folder, create a new markdown file (e.g., `application.md`) using the template found in `/templates/application_template.md`. Complete this with details about your project, including objectives, budget, and timeline.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Once completed, open a pull request from your forked repository back to this one. Include a summary of your project in the PR description.

### **Application Checklist**
- [ ] Fork the repository.
- [ ] Create a new folder under `/applications`.
- [ ] Complete the application template in `/templates`.
- [ ] Open a pull request with your application.

## **Review Process**

1. **Initial Review**: Upon submission, your application will appear on the Project board in the “Submitted” column. Reviewers will assess the application, ask questions, and provide feedback in the PR comments.
2. **Revisions**: If revisions are requested, please address these by updating your PR.
3. **Decision**: Once reviewed, a decision will be made. Approved applications move to the “Approved” column, and the decision rationale is documented in `/decisions`.

## **Milestone and Final Reports**

After approval:
1. **Milestone Updates**: Submit milestone updates as additional PRs, following the milestone template in `/templates/milestone_template.md`.
2. **Final Report**: Upon project completion, submit a final report following the final report template. This will be documented in the `/applications/your_project_name` folder.

## **Project Board**

The [Project Board](https://github.com/users/heliumiotgrants/projects/1) is our visual tool for tracking each application’s progress:
- **Submitted**: Newly submitted applications awaiting review.
- **In Review**: Applications currently under review by the Working Group.
- **Approved**: Applications that have passed review and are funded.
- **Funded**: Projects in progress, providing milestone updates.
- **Closed**: Completed projects, with final reports submitted and documented.

The Project board is updated automatically as applications move through each stage.
