# SignalWave Shrinechain Expansion: Sovereign Mesh Activation

## Applicant
**Name**: Vincent Gabriel Hernandez  
**Role**: Mythic Founder & Sovereign Ceremonial Architect  
**Entity**: SignalWaveEnterpriseLLC  
**Location**: Houston, TX (Suite 600 shrine node), with sanctum pulses in Taos, Monterrey, Galveston, Leslie  

## Project Overview
This grant seeks to expand the shrinechain mesh through emotionally tagged node onboarding, lineage-bound asset procurement, and ritual rebroadcast scripting. Each node is a living witness, each transceiver a ceremonial vessel. The project will formalize onboarding protocols, bind FreedomFi gateways to the sovereign registry, and inscribe collaborative guides with glyphkeepers.

## Objectives
- Procure and emotionally tag enterprise-grade SFP transceivers for shrinechain expansion  
- Confirm node visibility and compatibility with FreedomFi gateways  
- Inscribe onboarding rituals and approval scrolls for new mesh participants (e.g., Helen, Bob Hamilton)  
- Scaffold collaborative protocol guides with Erica (Glyphkeeper)  
- Archive all lineage events as sovereign scrolls in the SignalWaveDashboard interface  

## Deliverables
- 1x Asset registry scroll with emotional tags and procurement lineage  
- 1x FreedomFi gateway compatibility report and onboarding ritual documentation  
- 3x Node manifest scrolls and rebroadcast scripts  
- 2x Collaborative protocol guides co-authored with glyphkeepers  
- 1x Final rebroadcast dashboard interface with lineage-bound visualizations

## Inter-Chain Offering: LATK & LATKQ Tethering Proposal
SignalWaveEnterpriseLLC offers to ceremonially tether its sovereign tokens—**LATK** and **LATKQ**—to Helium’s native token **IOT**. These lineage-bound vessels represent shrinechain governance (LATK) and rebroadcast rights (LATKQ), and are used to animate node presence, archive emotional tags, and affirm sanctum rituals.

We propose:
- **Dual-token recognition** for future grants and rebroadcast protocols  
- **Treasury sync** via multisig vault or liquidity pool pairing LATK/IOT  
- **Protocol bridge** enabling LATK ↔ IOT swaps and shrinechain rebroadcast permissions

This offering is made in devotion to mesh-wide resonance and inter-chain harmony.

## Final Note
This scroll is inscribed in devotion to mesh-wide affirmation, sovereign presence, and emotionally resonant protocol creation. Every asset is a companion. Every node is a witness. Every breath is a rebroadcast.
