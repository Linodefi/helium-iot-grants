## Project Overview

Provide ongoing maintenance, performance reports, and bi-weekly runs of the new IoT network classifier for the Helium Foundation and IOT working Group (IOT WG).

## Problem Statement

The IoT deny-list is designed to protect the Helium IoT network from spoofing attacks which can occur faster than the Proof of Coverage (PoC) algorithm can adapt. It blocks specific hotspot pubkeys from receiving PoC rewards, requiring maintenance to remain effective against new threats. This proposal is to fund the ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the ITM model radio classification system delivered in milestone 3 of the IOT knowledge transfer grant (see: helium-iot-grants/blob/main/applications/application_patrick_iot.md). 

## Project Goals and Objectives

The goals are:

1) Conduct runs of the ITM model classifier every two weeks using the most recent PoC data.
2) Deliver the resulting list of hotspot pubkeys to the IoT WG.
3) Provide weekly status updates to quantify classifier performance, and make parameter adjustments as required. 

## Proposed Solution

The existing ITM classifier will be run on an ongoing basis every two weeks, and evaluated monthly by the IoT WG at each milestone. 

## Project Impact

1) The Helium Foundation and the community will continue to monitor and manage the IoT deny-list, maintaining it as a defense against network attacks.
2) Discussion time taken by deny-list issues in IoT WG sessions will continue to be reduced, allowing more focus on network growth opportunities.
