## Grant Request Summary
This grant request is to support the building of a hyper-local weather solution in the Caribbean country of Jamaica that can be utilized by the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, citizens and others year-round, but particularly during the tropical storm and hurricane season that heavily impacts the island, its people and businesses. 77 Helium WeatherXM stations have been supplied and are already in Jamaica as part of SensorETA’s participation in the WeatherXM+Swissborg deployment project. 

As with SensorETA’s other enterprise solution deployments, this solution will provide another excellent marketing use case for the Helium network. For examples, see these articles (Weather in Xochimilco (https://www.sensoreta.com/wxmxochimilco), Tracking for Proof of Recycling (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/proof-recycling-proving-circular-economy-larry-ketchersid-dzgec)).

This grant request covers costs for hotspots (both PoE and off-grid), a public custom dashboard utilizing the weather data plus educational materials and funding for marketing.

This proposal does assume up-front payment for the part of the proposal that would be utilized to procure the hotspots and associated equipment.

Total for the grant request is $43,995. Total that would be requested for up-front payment would be $26,892. The total budget includes an estimate of 25% for unexpected charges related to tariffs and customs fees, which should only be funded at the cost incurred based on receipts/invoices.

## Project Overview
Hurricane season is forecast to start in June, though in recent years tropical weather has affected the island earlier. The goal is to have these weather stations deployed before the start of these year’s tropical weather season.

The project will deploy 77 Helium WeatherXM stations in Jamaica, and the Helium hotspots needed to support their data transfer. WeatherXM and SensorETA have provided a map of suggested locations for deployment based on the stated goals and topology of the country. Working with local partners Electronic Technicians Training Limited (ETTL) (https://ettlonline.com), a communications technology company based in Jamaica, and with the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, actual locations (i.e., where deployment permission is granted, and where LoRaWAN coverage can be made available) for each of the stations has been laid out. Many of these locations are schools, with the goal of the deployment team to educate the STEM programs of these schools on this solution.

The 77 weather stations are already in Jamaica. SensorETA and WeatherXM shared the cost of customs and import fees, and the stations were provided by WeatherXM, with funding from VC Swissborg. Two IoT hotspots have been provided, and two weather stations have already been deployed by Ruel Waine Corniffe and the ETTL team.

Ruel and his team of four are highly motivated because of past experience with hurricanes to rapidly deploy hotspots and weather stations at the designated locations. Ruel has a long history in both communications technology and in disaster management in planning (for Jamaica and for some neighboring islands). 

WeatherXM, with this funding from VC Swissborg, is rolling out 2,300+ weather stations. Many of these (700+) are the Helium version of their weather stations. The goal of the project is to provide coverage to “underserved" areas. Therefore, most of these are in areas where there is no current LoRaWAN (or Helium) coverage, as well as a lack of weather data.

The project, paralleling the WeatherXM+Swissborg project, will last at least three years. Jamaica’s requirements for hyperlocal weather monitoring will, of course, extend beyond that.

In addition to ETTL, the Meteorological Service of Jamaica has offered a partnership agreement to SensorETA (and ETTL) to provide their on-going support for this solution. As it did with Trinidad and Tobago weather station deployment, SensorETa will assist the Meteorological Service in applying for a WeatherXM Research grant.

## Project Goals and Objectives
- Rollout 77 weather stations and the Helium hotspot infrastructure to support the weather stations data transport before the start of the 2025 hurricane season.
- Make the data actionable by providing a **public custom dashboard** for use by the by the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, citizens and others.
- Document this solution as a use case through video and articles.
- Increase the footprint of and usage of the Helium IoT network by providing hotspots and other infrastructure in support of the rollout of Helium IoT-based WeatherXM Weather stations.
-- Each station sends a 40-byte packet every three minutes, which, at 2 DC per packet, amounts to 960 DC per day, plus an additional set of packets totaling around 200 to 400 bytes daily.
-- The last time Leo from WeatherXM calculated WeatherXM's total DC usage a couple of months ago, it stood at roughly 18% of the Helium network’s total, based on 1,871 active stations, excluding those 200 to 400 bytes per day. WeatherXM has since increased to 2,205 active stations, and the additional 700 devices in this current WeatherXM+Swissborg project will likely raise the overall usage by around 30%, pushing WeatherXM's share to more than 25% of the network’s total DC consumption.
- Spread knowledge and ensure proper installations of the Helium IoT network by providing network testing devices such as GLAMOS to in-country deployers and distributing access to training materials.
- Increase visibility and viability of the Helium IoT network through joint marketing with WeatherXM, SensorETA and other deployers.
- Incentivize and empower local teams by explaining and demonstrating earning crypto through DePIN infrastructure (HNT, WXM, others)

## Proposed Solution
- Funding for **PoE and off-grid hotspots**. Many of these implementations will be in agricultural areas and will need solar power. The ones being implemented in schools or through partnership with the Meteorological Service of Jamaica will utilize PoE.
- Funding for **GLAMOS devices and educational kits** (to enable technical knowledge and ease of planning).
- Funding for a **custom dashboard** to be utilized by the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, citizens and others.
- Provide training and education, in the form of kits and/or online training similar to the “Helium Hacks” training programs of the past to ensure that local partners understand the Helium technology and are empowered to install and maintain equipment effectively.
- Provide and **publish use case upon completion**, to consist of (a) use case article published on LinkedIn and corporate websites, and as series on X/Twitter, Warpcast and others; and (b) video depiction of use case with footage from installations in Jamaica, including local deployers and other concerned parties in Jamaica, published on YouTube and LinkedIn. Will provide use case to partners (i.e., WeatherXM, Helium) for additional potential promotion. Will also provide use case to other outlets in attempt to widen coverage.
