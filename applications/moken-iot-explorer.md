## **Grant Request Summary**
To continue serving the Helium community effectively, we request **$80,000** to enhance the **Moken Helium IoT Explorer**, focusing on improved performance, user-driven features, and robust infrastructure.

Moken Explorer is a web-based tool that provides in-depth insights into Helium IoT hotspots, including earnings, data transfer counts, ranking, activity logs, witnessing patterns, and blockchain data stored on Solana. As usage grows, additional development and infrastructure improvements are required. Specifically, this grant will fund:

1. **Ongoing Development**: ~15 hours/week at $80/hour to develop requested features, optimize performance, and provide continuous enhancements over the next year.  
2. **Server and Infrastructure Costs**: Ensuring fast load times, scalability, and uptime as user traffic increases.

### **User Feedback Highlights**
We conducted a survey to determine key user needs, revealing high-demand feature requests:

- **Saved Links & Bookmarks** – Users want the ability to save and share direct links to specific data views.
- **Coverage & Diagnostics** – Users need interactive coverage maps and diagnostic tools for troubleshooting hotspot performance.
- **Performance & Reliability** – Faster load times, fewer crashes (especially in Chrome), and improved map rendering are essential.
- **Comparisons & Leaderboards** – Users want regional rankings, earnings comparisons, and performance benchmarks.
- **Analytics & Export** – CSV exports, historical earnings tracking, and multi-hotspot portfolio views.
- **UI/UX Enhancements** – More intuitive dashboards, better filtering options, dark mode refinements, and mobile/desktop widget support.

## **Project Overview**
Moken Explorer began as a free resource for Helium hotspot owners to monitor earnings and network activity. Since the migration to Solana and the rise of decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), its role has expanded significantly.

### **Why This Matters**
1. **Network Expansion**: As Helium supports new IoT projects (e.g., WeatherXM, agtech sensors), visibility into real-world usage and performance is crucial.
2. **Actionable Insights**: Reliable data helps users optimize deployments, identify coverage gaps, and maximize earnings.
3. **Community Education**: Making Helium data accessible empowers users to make informed decisions and improve network participation.

## **Goals & Objectives**
1. **Enhance Functionality & Performance**
   - Implement key user-requested features like saved links, enhanced coverage maps, and improved diagnostics.
   - Optimize performance to reduce crashes and ensure smooth UI interactions.
2. **Improve Diagnostic Tools**
   - Provide insights into transmit scale changes, witness losses, and denial causes.
3. **Expand Data & Analytics**
   - Enable CSV exports, multi-hotspot tracking, and advanced filters.
4. **Strengthen Community Resources**
   - Develop tutorials, documentation, and AI-powered recommendations to help users optimize hotspot placement.
5. **Maintain High-Performance Infrastructure**
   - Upgrade server resources to accommodate increased traffic and prevent performance bottlenecks.

## **Proposed Solution**
1. **Development Hours** – Allocate ~15 hours/week of dedicated development time for ongoing feature updates and improvements.
2. **Infrastructure Enhancements** – Invest in scalable hosting solutions to support high-traffic demand.
3. **Feature Implementation**
   - **User Experience Improvements** – Enhanced navigation, coverage visualization, and real-time data insights.
   - **Analytics & Reporting** – CSV exports, historical comparisons, and multi-hotspot monitoring.
   - **Diagnostic Tools** – Intuitive displays for offline, denied, or poorly performing hotspots.
   - **Notifications & Alerts** – Email or in-app alerts for outages, performance dips, and other key changes.
4. **Community Collaboration** – Alpha/beta testing with Helium users to fine-tune new features.
