## Grant Request Summary
This grant request seeks **$80,000** to expand the functionality, performance, and user experience of the **Moken Helium IOT Explorer**. The Moken Explorer is a web-based tool that exposes all available information for a Helium IoT hotspot—such as earnings, data transfer counts, rank, activity lists, witnessed and beaconed hotspots, and details stored on the Solana blockchain.

Moken Explorer has grown into an essential resource for hotspot owners and the broader Helium IoT community. However, as usage expands, additional development hours and robust server infrastructure are needed to keep pace with user requests. Specifically, this grant will fund:
1. **Ongoing Development**: ~15 hours/week at \$80/hour to build requested features, address performance issues, and roll out enhancements over the next year.  
2. **Server and Infrastructure Costs**: Maintaining high-speed servers and reliability as user traffic increases.

### Highlights From Our User Survey
We conducted a survey asking users what improvements they wanted to see in the Moken Explorer. Below is a summary of the most frequent and impactful requests:

- **Working/Saved Links**  
  Many users requested stable direct links (bookmarks) to specific data views.  

- **Coverage & Diagnostics**  
  A top request was displaying coverage data and hotspot diagnostics. Users want to see how their hotspot coverage areas overlap with neighbors, distance to witnesses, and how to diagnose issues (denials, 0.20 transmit scale, etc.).  

- **Performance & Reliability**  
  Feedback included requests for faster load times, fewer crashes (particularly in Chrome), and a more optimized map display.  

- **Comparisons & Leaderboards**  
  Users want ways to compare hotspots (by location, earnings, or coverage) and see a top-rank listing within geographic areas (e.g., city or region).  

- **Analytics & Export**  
  Many asked for CSV exports of historical data, more advanced analytics, deeper insights into daily/weekly earnings, and the ability to track multiple hotspots at once (wallet-wide or portfolio view).  

- **UI/UX Enhancements**  
  Suggestions included more intuitive dashboards, robust filtering, dark mode improvements, offline notifications, and the option for a mobile or desktop widget.

In short, Moken Explorer is already popular, but users are eager for more robust features, reliability, and speed.

## Project Overview
The **Moken Helium IOT Explorer** started as a free tool to give Helium hotspot owners deeper visibility into their devices’ earnings and performance data. With the Helium network migration to Solana and the continuing expansion of DePIN projects, the Explorer has become integral for analyzing coverage, data usage, rank, and subnetwork activity. 

### Why This Matters
1. **Helium Data Growth**: As more IoT deployments arrive on Helium (e.g., WeatherXM, agtech sensors), Moken Explorer can help owners and the broader ecosystem visualize actual usage, coverage, and reliability.  
2. **Network Insights**: Timely and accurate Helium network metrics spur better decision-making—identifying coverage gaps, comparing performance, and encouraging improvements.  
3. **Community Education**: By making advanced or hidden hotspot data more transparent, Moken Explorer helps users troubleshoot issues, optimize setups, and gain confidence in Helium’s potential.

## Project Goals and Objectives
1. **Enhance Functionality and Performance**  
   - Implement user-requested features such as saved links, improved coverage visualizations, distance metrics, and advanced analytics.  
   - Reduce crashes and optimize map data to ensure a smooth user experience.

2. **Improve Diagnostics and Clarity**  
   - Surface deeper diagnostics (e.g., transmit scale changes, witness loss reasons, denial explanations).  

3. **Expand User-Friendly Tools**  
   - Offer CSV exports and data integrations so advanced users can run their own analysis.  
   - Allow portfolio or wallet-level overviews and leaderboards for local/regional hotspots.

4. **Educate and Empower the Community**  
   - Provide clear, actionable insights for maximizing hotspot performance (e.g., antenna suggestions, location tips).  
   - Create documentation, tutorials, or possibly AI-driven hints to help both newcomers and experienced operators.

5. **Sustain High-Speed Infrastructure**  
   - Maintain reliable hosting and scale servers to support thousands of daily users without lag or downtime.  

---

## Proposed Solution
1. **Development Hours**: Dedicate ~15 hours/week of developer time for one year (total 780 hours) to incorporate new features, respond to user feedback, and perform ongoing maintenance.  
2. **Infrastructure and Server Costs**: Allocate part of the funding toward high-performance hosting to ensure fast response times, especially for map visualizations and real-time data retrieval.  
3. **Implementation of Key Features**  
   - **User Experience Enhancements**: Bookmarked links, improved layout, coverage filters, distance/witness calculators, and new ways to compare hotspots.  
   - **Analytics & Exports**: CSV export, multi-hotspot dashboards, historical comparisons, and advanced filtering.  
   - **Diagnostics and Status Tools**: More intuitive display of denied, blocked, offline, or scaled hotspots, plus recommended next steps.  
   - **Notifications & Alerts**: Email or in-app alerts for performance drops, offline events, or changes in scale/witnessing.  
4. **Community Feedback and Iteration**  
   - Conduct alpha/beta testing cycles with the Helium community to refine features before public release.
