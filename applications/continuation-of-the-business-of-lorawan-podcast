# Grant Proposal: Continuation of The Business of LoRaWAN Podcast

## Executive Summary

This proposal seeks continued funding of **$60,000** ($5,000/month for 12 months, paid in 4-month tranches) to support the next year of *The Business of LoRaWAN* podcast and accompanying written content.

The first grant period has been completed successfully, with deliverables **exceeded**:
- 33 podcast episodes (vs. 24 promised)
- 7 written articles (vs. 6 promised)
- 2 bonus IoT demonstration projects (sled and parking sensor)

The continuation phase will build on this strong foundation, publishing:
- **Weekly podcast episodes (52 total)**
- **Monthly articles (12 total)**

Podcasts require sustained investment and audience development to reach their full impact. Early results have been encouraging: steady listenership growth, strong community engagement, and increasing references to Helium in both podcast content and organic trade show conversations. Extending this grant ensures Helium continues to be positioned as a leader in LoRaWAN and IoT while the show matures into a durable, long-term asset for awareness and adoption.
