# Milestone Update

## Project Title
Nova Labs IoT Classifiers and Knowledge Transfer

## Milestone Number
Milestone 3

## Milestone Summary
The goal of Milestone 3 is to create a new classifier to help secure the IoT network against spoofing attacks.

## Progress Update
- **Completed Objectives**: Extended the existing classifiers to address emerging threats  
- **In-progress Objectives**: None

A new classification service, based on the ITM model for radio propagation, was created. The service identifies beaconerâ€“witness pairs exhibiting behavior consistent with spoofing. PDF report cards explaining model results for each hotspot are also generated for distribution to the community.

## Challenges and Adjustments

### Challenges

The primary challenge addressed during Milestone 3 was the computational cost of the ITM model. To support large-scale evaluation, a parallelized, memory-safe batched implementation was developed. Since the model operations are not vectorized by default, the pipeline was built to avoid resource exhaustion on commodity hardware.

## Budget Update (if applicable)

Milestone 3 was completed within the allocated budget.

## Next Steps

Milestone 3 concludes the IoT denylist knowledge transfer grant. A proposal for ongoing maintenance and support will be presented to the IoT working group by the end of June 2025.
