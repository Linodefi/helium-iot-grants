# Background on multiple grant proposals

This directory includes four grant proposals that have very similar formats. Each of them are in support of the WeatherXM+Swissborg project rolling out WeatherXM stations to underserved areas. Of the 2,700+ weather stations, approximately 700 are the Helium versions.

These four requests are for off-grid hotspots, testing devices (GLAMOS) and training materials to build the Helium IoT knowledge and infrastructure in Liberia, Venezuela, Jamaica and Kenya. This would not only enable the rollout of the WeatherXM stations, but increase traffic on the network, train in-country teams on Helium, IoT, DePIN and other essentials, and provide multiple diverse use cases.

These are split by country in order to have granularity for the IoT working group. Each file discussed the partners, the countries and the use cases in detail.

There are several other countries that Helium weather stations are being rolled out to. Happy to discuss others if desired.
