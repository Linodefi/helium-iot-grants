## Grant Request Summary
This grant request is for hotspots, infrastructure and training to support the deployment of WeatherXM stations in the Caribbean country of Jamaica as part of the WeatherXM+Swissborg deployment project. 

Total for the grant request is $28,000.

## Project Overview
WeatherXM, with funding from VC Swissborg, is rolling out 2,300+ weather stations. Many of these (700+) are the Helium version of their weather stations. The goal of the project is to provide coverage to “underserved areas. Therefore, most of these are in areas where there is no current LoRaWAN (or Helium) coverage, as well as a lack of weather data.

28 of these weather stations have been delivered to Jamaica with 50 more in transit as of this writing.

SensorETA is working with one organization in Jamaica that (1) wants to create a hurricane and tropical weather network for the island, (2) are farmers and will deploy stations in agricultural areas as well, and (3) are trained telecommunications technicians. With LoRaWAN soil, CO2 and WeatherXM stations, we are working with these organization to not only help them with these agriculture projects but laying the groundwork of a foundation for carbon credits.

One of the most common comments in the Helium IoT Working Group weekly calls and Discord is the need to increase usage of the network.

The most straightforward project to increase usage of the network, while also increasing the worldwide footprint of the network and the education and understanding of Helium IoT is to do anything and everything to support this rollout of WeatherXM stations.

SensorETA is the lead partner with WeatherXM on this rollout. SensorETA has a layered approach to its enterprise IoT solution implementations, building as needed from the network up to and including utilizing sensor data to help build the case for carbon credits for our implementation partners. SensorETA is the IoT partner for carbon credit companies like Arva Intelligence, helping that company build on its leading carbon credit machine learning algorithms with targeted sensor data.

In Jamaica, SensorETA's partner is:
- Electronic Technicians Training Limited (ETTI) (https://ettlonline.com), a communications technology company based in Jamaica. ETTI is led by Ruel Waine Corniffe who has setup and climbed most of the cell towers in Jamaica. Ruel’s team is motivated by recent weather events effecting the island and impacting the agricultural output. 

Many of our in-country partners that are targeted for weather stations have pushed back on the Helium version, requesting WiFi version instead. This is mainly due to (1) funding for hotspots, in most cases off-grid hotspots; (2) lack of technical knowledge of Helium or LoRaWAN. This grant request is to address both hurdles.

For these IoT working group proposals, each country's deployment and the in-country projects that the deployment will support and nurture are separated into separate proposals.

## Project Goals and Objectives
- Increase the footprint of and usage of the Helium IoT network by providing hotspots and other infrastructure in support of the rollout of Helium IoT-based WeatherXM Weather stations.
-- Each station sends a 40-byte packet every three minutes, which, at 2 DC per packet, amounts to 960 DC per day, plus an additional set of packets totaling around 200 to 400 bytes daily.
-- The last time Leo from WeatherXM calculated WeatherXM's total DC usage a couple of months ago, it stood at roughly 18% of the Helium network’s total, based on 1,871 active stations, excluding those 200 to 400 bytes per day. WeatherXM has since increased to 2,205 active stations, and the additional 700 devices in this current WeatherXM+Swissborg project will likely raise the overall usage by around 30%, pushing WeatherXM's share to more than 25% of the network’s total DC consumption. 
- Spread knowledge and ensure proper installations of the Helium IoT network by providing network testing devices such as GLAMOS to in-country deployers and distributing access to training materials.
- Increase visibility and viability of the Helium IoT network through joint marketing with WeatherXM, SensorETA and other deployers.
- Incentivize and empower local teams by explaining and demonstrating earning crypto through DePIN infrastructure (HNT, WXM, others)

## Proposed Solution
- Providing funding for off-grid hotspots. Many of these implementations will be agricultural and will need solar power. This could include the “dual-miner” hotspots to support the Sourceful Energy network to provide further local incentives.
- Providing funding for GLAMOS devices (to enable technical knowledge and ease of planning).
- Providing training and education, in the form of kits and/or online training similar to the “Helium Hacks” training programs of the past to ensure that local partners understand the Helium technology and are empowered to install and maintain equipment effectively.

## Timeline and Milestones
Weather stations have already been shipped and received.

| Milestone | Description | Expected Completion Date |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Milestone 1 | Procure and Ship Hotspots, Testing Devices, Kits | Day of Funding |
| Milestone 2 | Training | On-going and already occurring |
| Milestone 3 | Initial Hotspot and Weather Station installation | Milestone 2 + 1 week |
| Milestone 4 | Final Hotspot and Weather Station installation | Milestone 3 + 4 weeks |
| Milestone 5 | Case Study and Marketing for in-country partners | Milestone 3 + 4 weeks |

## KPIs / Metrics

Through each milestone, the project team will provide metrics on:
- Number of weather stations deployed
- Number of hotspots installed
- Amount of data transmitted over the Helium Network
- Number of local community members trained on Helium technology

## Budget

| Item | Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| Off-grid hotspots (hotspot, antenna, solar, backhaul) (qty 15) | $22,500 | 
| Testing Devices (qty 3) | $600 |
| IoT Education Kits and Courses (qty 3) | $750 |
| Shipping and Customs Fees (est 20%) | $3,240
